WELCOME

Hello everyone! Welcome to my super duper small ASTRO 7N script I made. 
I made this script, because I found the dialogue to be really boring and I wanted a faster way to speed through it. 
The purpose of this script is to spam through the dialogue and questions given throughout the dialogue by the narrator. 
It spams the dialogue while at the same time pausing when encountering a copper quiz so you don't lose points. 


INSTALLATION

You can either activate the virtual environment I have uploaded to the github repository, or install the modules yourself. 
Remember to keep your version of pip and python up to date when installing. 
Here are the commands to install the modules:
pip install pillow
pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui


EXECUTION

Double click the ASTRO_7N.py file. 
If you prefer to run python files in an IDE or some text editor, feel free to do so as well. 
Press 'ESC' and '`' together to stop the program.
The buttons should be directly next to each other vertically on your keyboard. 
After stopping, the program needs to be started again manually. 
In order to use the script and start spamming, press 'SHIFT' + 'CTRL'.
