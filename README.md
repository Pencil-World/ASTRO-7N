## WELCOME
Hello everyone! Welcome to my super duper small ASTRO 7N script I made. 
I made this script, because I found the dialogue to be really boring and I wanted a faster way to speed through it. 
The purpose of this script is to spam through the dialogue and questions given throughout the dialogue by the narrator. 
It spams the dialogue while at the same time pausing when encountering a copper quiz so you don't lose points. 
The main file is [ASTRO_7N.py](ASTRO_7N.py). 
But an alternate, slower version is [ASTRO_7N_slow.py](https://github.com/Pencil-World/ASTRO-7N?tab=readme-ov-file#astro_7n_slowpy). 

## INSTALLATION
Make sure to download the files you want from this branch before proceeding to the rest of the guide. 
Download or copy/paste the code from the [ASTRO_7N.py](ASTRO_7N.py) file. 
You can either create a virtual environment or install the modules directly. 
If you create a virtual environment, make sure to activate it. 
Here are the commands to install the modules:
```
pip install pillow
pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui
```
If your computer has different specifications visit each module's installation guides. [Pillow install](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html). [Keyboard install](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/). [Pyautogui install](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). 
>[!Note]
>Remember to keep your version of pip and python up to date when installing. 

## EXECUTION
There are three main methods to execute the program. 
1. **IDE or source-code editor**: This is for people who are already comfortable using such tools. I won't delve into this method here. 
2. **Using the Terminal**: This requires you to open the Terminal. 
3. **Opening With**: This requires either Finder from **macOS** or File Explorer from **Windows**. 
### Using the Terminal
Open the Terminal. 
Locate the file location of where your [ASTRO_7N.py](ASTRO_7N.py) file is. For **macOS** use `ls` and `cd`. For **Windows** use `dir` and `cd`. Next, open the file using python. The command for **macOS** is `sudo python3 ASTRO_7N.py`. The command for **Windows** is `python ASTRO_7N.py`.
### Opening With
Locate the file using either Finder for **macOS** or File Explorer for **Windows**. Right click the file and click `Open With` and then `python`. 

Once starting the program, read the following instructions on how to operate it. 
Press `ESC` and `[backtick]` together to stop the program.
The buttons should be directly next to each other vertically on your keyboard. 
After stopping, the program needs to be started again manually. 
In order to use the script and start spamming, press `SHIFT` and `CTRL`.

## ASTRO_7N_slow.py
All instructions are the same except execution. Replace `ASTRO_7N.py` in the commands with `ASTRO_7N_slow.py`. For execution, press `RIGHT SHIFT` and `TAB` together to stop the program. To use the script, press `RIGHT SHIFT`.
